    <main id="main">
        <div class="word">
            <p>Before I came to USA, I had lived in Shanghai since I was born.
                In 2015, I participated in the college entrance examination and was then admitted to University of
                Michigan - Shanghai Jiatong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI).
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time, I was very nervous to study there because the official language for this institute is
                English and I had never thought of studying everything in English.
                To make things worse, I had little background in my major - Electrical and Computer Engineering.
                Fortunately, I made a quick adaptation to the new environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017 winter, I exchanged to University of Navarra for one month, studying Spanish.
                I would like to learn Spanish because Spanish is the second most spoken language in the world.
                Also, it was my first time to Europe, and it was a great opportunity for me to know about a different
                culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when I came back to China, I found that there was not much Spanish language course in
                Shanghai.
                In other words, it was hard for me to continue learning Spanish during the semesters in my university.
                Therefore, I chose German as my second major in SJTU and after a year of study, I successfully got a
                chance to exchange to Technical University of Berlin for one month in 2018 winter, studying 3D
                printing.
                In this case, not only could I practice my oral German ability with native speakers, but I was also
                able to experince the local customs.
                By the way, 3D printing was a very cool technology for me and the equipments there was more advanced
                than in SJTU.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I came back from Berlin, I had a tough time finding an intern as well as preparing TOEFL and GRE
                tests for applications for graduate schools.
                I also decided my track in the future to be either data science or computer engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of April, it occurred to me that University of Michigan School of Information offered JI
                students a 3+2 MSI program that allowed us, junior students, to study data analytics/science there as
                graduate students.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why I am here, and where my new life begins.
